I’ve spent about 12 hours trying to configure panda 3d and get models and a working test going. I spent about 7 hours over the weekend figuring out panda 3d and learning tutorials, and about another 5 getting textures to work on a board and putting a panda on the board, along with coding the board reader and doing the first deliverable.
