For my 15-112 term project, I intend to recreate an age-old game called Pac Man. Instead of the old way of defeating one level and going on to the next, players may choose to go to the next level through a portal whenever they please, at the cost of a certain number of points. I will be implementing this in Panda-3D to make level switches seem to occur as if you’re going up a tower. Additionally, I would like to implement a level editor so that users may make their own levels. This should be fairly simple to do, because levels are read through .txt files. The AI should work as it does on the original game, with each ghost having a specific method to try and catch pac-man. If possible, I will use the A* pathfinder for one of the ghosts to try and cut off another ghost.
        The board itself will be a two-dimensional board looked at from a three dimensional camera angle, so the board is on a tilt. Pacman will be on this board, however he will not be tilted. He will appear upright to the viewer, as will all of the ghosts chasing him. When a certain number of pellets are eaten, then a portal will appear and pacman can continue to increase his score by eating pellets on the current board or elect to go up a board, to a new level. Higher levels will get increasingly more difficult with faster ghosts and more difficult pathways. There will be a tradeoff as previous levels cannot be revisited, so you will lower your remaining score once you transfer to the next level.
        Additionally, I will make a level editor (possibly in TKinter for simplicity) that will allow players to move and place pipes and pellets and then give the level a name which can then be played on the main game. This is a feature not commonly seen in pac-man games.
