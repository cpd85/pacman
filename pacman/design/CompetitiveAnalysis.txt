Pac-man is a game that has been created and re-created for years. For my term project, i am planning on putting a unique twist on it. The concept of switching levels without completing the level before will put a new aspect of strategy. Also, looking at a two dimensional board from a three dimensional perspective will be more visually interesting and appealing. Additionally, level editors are not commonly featured in pac-man and this will bring a new level of interest into the game. However, this game will be similar to most pac-man games in that pac-man will travel around trying to eat pellets and avoiding ghosts. A few compelling features that i would like to include in my program are high scores lists, and maybe multiplayer if i have extra time. I would like to compete these features through my tower-level system.
